					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>hi whatever. i'm L. it doesn't matter at all.</p>

					<h2>About NADDPOD GREATEST STORY OF ALL TIME</h2>
					<p>Naddpod is a really awesome and cool dungeons and dragons actual play podcast. Essentially a group of people (Emily Axford, Caldwell Tanner and Jake Herwitz) all sit around and record themselves playing DND with their dungeon master (Brian Murphy). And you've probably heard of what dnd is by now. So.
						Naddpod is split into 3 main campaigns and a few bonus mini-campaigns. The main arcs make up the bulk of the podcast, with mini-campaigns set in-between them, usually acting as filler content for haitus/vacations/breaks
						The 3 main campaigns are: Bahumia, Eldermourne, and Ba-two-mia. I'll talk about Campaign 1 & 3, which are set in the same world and also the ones I'm crazy crazy bone crazy about</p>
					<p>Bahumia is the story set after the campaign. The three legendary heroes who saved the world once before have disappeared, and left the world in total chaos. It's now up to a new band of heroes to defend Bahumia from threats up high and down below
						the PCS of bahumia are.... MOONSHINE CYBIN - a crick elf who wields both the wrathful power of nature and the fertile power of huge boobs. BEVERLY TOEGOLD THE FIFTH - A city halfling and a proud boyscout of the Green Teens. The only thing that rivals his merit badge collection is his growing collection of dads. Last but not least - HARDWON SUREFOOT bastard of the mountain, the bravest warrior of irondeep. He's a virgin and he isn't over his highschool ex-girlfriend. These 3 heroes will go on to SAVE THE REALM OF BAHUMIA through the power of GOOFS, SCOOPS & ONE BIG BED</p>

					<p>	Of course. the whole point of the Bahumia setting is that the world can't just be saved THE ONE TIME. It's two hundred years later, and who's going to save this new world, ravaged by capitalist megacorporations and entropic destiny
						that brings us to the PCS of ba2mia!!!! Starring: CALLIOPE PETRICHOR - a rainy-day-fae with a broken heart and a penchant for picking up animal familiars. CALDER KILDE - a looming 8ft tall goliath from a village of even bigger, 20 ft, frost giants. He has permenant 'little baby brother syndrome'. And of course... SOLUM BUFO - The HOTTEST FROG you've ever dang seen in your LIFE. He's strong! He's agile! He grows mushrooms out of his chest! And most importantly he's the lamest freak you could ever talk to! These bitches are the most theatre-kid coded characters I've ever seen. They're DUCK TEAM and they SUCK!!!!
						Anyway. Yadda yadda they destroy an entire town, unleash a mad AI set on absorbing Bahumia into a hivemind, reveal the ancient prophecy of Oberon's wrath on the material plane, get trapped in a helmet, etc etc.... The most important part is they're really lame while doing it. Also hardwon shows up again and he's in a depression spiral. Also they all make out together on the reg (i didn't make that up. or did i? you should probably listen to 320 hours of contect to make sure)</p>

						<p>	Now you might be asking yourself: Is this a pitch? He's just describing characters? That's nothing at all. Well jokes on you cunt because I am a straight FREAK and I like RECITING WIKIA ARTICLES FROM MEMORY and YES I HAVE HOMEWORK TO DO RIGHT NOW BUT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT NADDPOD
						Essay concluded. :] Everyone listen to NADDPOD and idk. I'll give you $20???</p>
