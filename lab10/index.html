					<h2>What I did for this Lab</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we used DOM manipulation to generate random fake dialogue in the format of a text conversation.
					</p>

				<div id="problems">
					<h2>Difficulties encountered</h2>
					<p>The basic task of this assignment was pretty simple, since I could just copy over the sample text. I decided to replace the lorem ipsum text with Simlish (from the game the Sims) and then change the CSS so that the output looked like a whatsapp message. To do that I used whatsapp web and inspected the css to copy the stylesheet. This was slightly difficult, as I had to hunt down the specific lines of codes that informed the colours I wanted to find.</p>
					<p>Then I wanted to try and make a second button so that the user could reply to the gibberish message. I reused some of the code from Lab 7, to accept user input and then append it to the div. I had to do somre research to figure out how to get the tect to align on the right. But after some experimentation and fixing typos, I was able to do it!
