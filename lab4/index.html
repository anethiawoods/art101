			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>What I did for this Lab</h2>
					<p>For this Lab, my partner and I worked together to pseudocode instructions for baking cookies and the game Minesweeper. Then we put in into our javascript files as comments. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Difficulties encountered</h2>
					<p>I definitely underestimated the difficulty of psuedocoding even simple everyday tasks I do all the time. For baking cookies, Kristine and I were imagining making a list for an alien/robot who had never seen or heard of baking before. We tried to make instructions that were as straightforward and broken down as possible, which meant spelling out a lot of tasks that we would norally implicitly understand. </p>
					<p>Pseudocoding Minesweeper was particularly hard. I hadn't realised how complicated the internal workings of the game could be. We realised that before we even got to the actual steps, we would have to define a lot of terms. We had to reference some examples to figure out how we could order and word it.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>The results...</h2>
					<p>Here is our final pseudocode! I think our lists are pretty clear and broken down. </p>
					<h3>Pseudocode for baking!</h3>
<pre><code>
	Google ‘recipe for cookies’
	Go to the pantry
		Check pantry for all necessary ingredients & tools 
			Necessary ingredients: flour, sugar, unsalted butter, baking soda, chocolate chips, eggs, vanilla extract, salt
			Necessary tools:2 large bowls, whisk, baking pan, parchment paper, measuring cups
		If missing ingredient or tool, go to the store
			Locate needed ingredients or tools in store
			Place ingredients or tools in basket
			Go to check-out counter
			Pay for items
			Go home with ingredients or tools
		If all ingredients and tools are obtained, place them on the kitchen counter
	Measure ingredients according to recipe, match the required amounts of each ingredient by name and amount 
		Example: If recipe states ¾ cup of flour then measure ¾ cup of flour
	Categorize and separate wet and dry ingredients
		Wet ingredients: sugar, unsalted butter, eggs, vanilla extract
		Dry ingredients: flour, salt, baking soda, and chocolate chips 
	According to the measured amounts, place the dry ingredients into the large bowl
	According to the measured amounts, place the wet ingredients into a separate bowl 
		Use whisk to beat the mixture until doubled the size and evenly incorporated
		Ensure the eggs are cracked with the yolk and white added to the wet mixture and the shells discarded
	Add dry ingredient mixture into the bowl containing the wet mixture. 
	Mix both the wet and dry ingredients with the whisk until the mixture reaches an even consistency
		Even consistency is indicated by all ingredients except for the chocolate chips to not have observable streaks or other distinct patches from one another in the mixture. 
		Chocolate chips should be distributed evenly throughout the overall mixture
	Remove whisk from the overall mixture
	Place the mixture into the fridge
	Preheat the oven to 350F
	Put away the excess ingredients into the pantry
	When the oven reaches 350F take the cookie mix out of the fridge
	Line the baking pan with parchment paper
	Wash hands and then dry hands
	Scoop out handful-sized dollops of cookie mix onto the parchment paper in equal portions until the mixture runs out 
		Make sure the dollops are distributed evenly throughout the pan 
		From the pan’s borders, ensure there is a ½ inch margin between the dollops of cookie mix and the sides of the pan
		Limit the amount of dollops on the pan to be 8 total. If cookie mix remains, run the dollops over to a new pan prepared the same way as the previous 
	Place the baking pan with unbaked cookies into the heated oven
		If more than one pan is created, place in the oven as well within the oven rack’s area while not overlapping the pans over another 
	Wait for 20 minutes for the cookie mixture to transform into cookies
	Clean up while waiting
		Wipe the kitchen counter table with a rag and soap
		Take the used tools to the sink
		Wash tools with water and soap until no longer greasy
		Place washed tools on drying rack
	Take the pan out of the oven
		pan is created, take the excess pans out of the oven as well 
	Turn off the oven 
	Let cookies cool for 20 minutes. Afterwards, remove the cookies from the pan 
	Eat the cookies until full
	Place leftover cookies into a box
	Give box to a deserving friend

					<h3>Pseudocode for Minesweeper!</h3>
<pre><code>
	Define the three cell states
		An unopened cell is blank 
		An opened cell displays whether it is a ‘mine cell’ or a ‘non-mine cell’
			An unopened cell can become an opened cell by left clicking on it
			If it is a “non-mine cell’, the open cell will then display a number indicating how many mines are diagonal or adjacent to it 
		A flagged cell covers an unopened cell with an image of a flag
			An unopened cell can become a flagged cell by right clicking on it
			A flagged cell can be converted back to an unopened cell by right clicking on it
	Define lose condition
		If the player opens a ‘mine cell’
	Define win condition
		If all the ‘non-mine cells’ are opened cells and all the ‘mine cells’ are unopened or flagged cells
	Set up the board
		Generate a game board of 8x8 cells
		Randomly select 10 tiles to be designated as ‘mine cells’
		The remaining 54 tiles are designated as ‘non-mine cells’
		Start the game with all 64 cells being unopened cells 
	Start timer from 00:00 
	In the corner, keep track of and display ‘flag number’
		The flag number starts at 10
		Everytime an unopened cell is converted to a flagged cell, subtract 1 from the flag number
		If flag cell is removed, add one to the flag number 
	Accept user input 
	After each user input, check for lose or win condition
		If lose condition is met, replace the revealed mine tile with an explosion tile. Starting from this tile, replace all adjacent cells with explosion tiles until all tiles are explosion tiles
		If win condition is met, play animation of confetti bursting
		If lose or win condition is met, stop timer and display final timer number
		If lose or win condition is met, display a button with the text ‘new game?’
			If ‘new game’ button is clicked with the left mouse button, restart the code procedure
