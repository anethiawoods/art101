					<h2>What I did for this Lab</h2>
					<p>For this lab I put an input form field for users to enter their fullname. Then I used conditionals + jquery to assign the user a NADDPOD character based on the string. To add more complexity, I assigned characters on both the <i>length</i> and <i>divisibility</i> of the string! </p>

				<div id="problems">
					<h2>Difficulties encountered</h2>
					<p>I had so many problems with this. For a start I couldn't figure out the code at all... I pretty much had to rewatch the lecture, I think I had forgotten some pretty basic stuff. After that I fiddled with the code on JS Bin. That worked fine, until I tried transferring it to VS Code editor. It took me a long while debugging to figure it out... After narrowing it down, I realised the problem was that no matter what clicking the button wouldn;t do anything, so I figured there must have been something wrong with the JQUERY/JS File links. Eventually I realised I forgot to write 'DEFER' when linking the JS file!</p>
