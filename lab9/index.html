					<h2>What I did for this Lab</h2>
					<p>Oh hello! For this assignment, we had to use jquery to add buttons to our site that would change the css of certain elements!</p>
				</div>	

				<div id="problems">
					<h2>Difficulties encountered</h2>
					<p>
						I had to do some debugging for the button in the challenges section - I spent so long messing around with ids & classes because I couldn't figure out why the code I was writing worked on JSBin but not on my local files.... It turned out I had linked the JS file wrongly in the head! (RIP). Because I wanted to <i>start</i> with the text collapsed, I had to experiment with visibility, different displays and the !important tag.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id="results">
					<h2>The results...</h2>
					<p>I think all the code is working as they should & the buttons do what I tell them to do! Hooray :)</p>
