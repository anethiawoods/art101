					<h2>What I did for this Lab</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we needed to add an input form field to our page, that would take in a value and return it to the site</p>
				</div>	

				<div id="problems">
					<h2>Difficulties encountered</h2>
					<p>Overall it was a pretty straightforward process. The only problem arose when I was trying to figure out how I wanted the sorted nate to be output on the site. At first, I used 'append'. However, every time I put in a new value into the input field, it would keep adding on to the back of the old answers. Alternatively if I used the 'html' to replace the entire output ID, then you would have to restart the page to try another value... So instead I put in a little 'p' tag below where the sorted name would be output to</p>

				<div id="results">
					<h2>The results...</h2>
					<p>The whole thing was pretty mangeable, and the basic code works sa it should</p>
