					<h2>What I did for this Lab</h2>
					<p>For this lab, I declared some variables in the javascript file, then output those variables onto the site.</p>
			
					<h2>Difficulties encountered</h2>
					<p>The first problem I encountered was figuring out how to make each variable output be on a different line. After some testing with the code, I realised I had forgotten to put in the line break tag. Then I went to mess around a little more with the CSS stylesheet, and I took some time trying to figure out how to colour the script ourput text and how to fix an image to the bottom of a browser window. 
					</p>
					
					<h2>The results...</h2>
					<p>The javascript portion of this exercise was pretty doable, although I had some minot problems due to mistyping/errors. But the javascript & CSS is working as it should. </p>
