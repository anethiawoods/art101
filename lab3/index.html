			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>What I did for this Lab</h2>
					<p>The main tasks for this lab were to check up on my file structure, polish up my homepage, and to add this page to my github site.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Difficulties encountered</h2>
					<p>The process as a whole ran pretty smoothly. I had already been trying out some of the tasks for this lab before it was assigned, so I didn't have too many problems understanding the code.</p>
					<p>Maybe the only minor challenge was figuring out how to centre images in a site, as well as editing the css for my homepage so that I could make 2 images sit side-by-side. That required a bit of trial & error. </p>
					<p>The last problem was also just time... Originally I had planned to be pretty ambitious. I wanted to figure out how to implement the psuedo-class hover & make one of my photos clickable & lead to another page. I did not have enough time to figure that out before the assignmet was due :( Hopefully I can try it out over the weekend!</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>The results...</h2>
					<p>I'm pretty satisfied with how the final home-page looks. Everything looks & works pretty much how it should and I even added extra photos of my cat! Which is always good :D  </p>
