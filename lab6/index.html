			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>What I did for this Lab</h2>
					<p>For this Lab, I experimented with Object & Arrays in my browser's consoles, then transferred that information to my javascript folder. I declared the variables & objects, which were then output onto my site.</p>
			
					<h2>Difficulties encountered</h2>
					<p>I did a lot of experimentation in the console with how to delcare arrays and objects, as well as what the methods we learned in class did (like shift, pop, reverse, etc...). During this I made a couple of mistakes that I had to figure out how to correct, such as declaring/adding elements wrongly. However, it was usually prety clear what I had to fix, so the overall process was quite smooth. Transferring the variables from the console to the javascript was also pretty painless, aside from a few typos and missed semicolons that I had to look out for.
					</p>
					
					<h2>The results...</h2>
					<p>I'm pretty sure the variables have been output as theyre supposed to.</p>
